![build status](https://travis-ci.org/threepointone/glamor.svg)

css in your javascript

`npm install glamor --save`

usage
```jsx
import { css } from 'glamor'

// make css rules
let rule = css({
  color: 'red',
  ':hover': {
    color: 'pink'
  },
  '@media(min-width: 300px)': {
    color: 'green',
    ':hover': {
      color: 'yellow'
    }
  }
})

// add as data attributes
<div {...rule} {...another}>
  zomg
</div>

// or as classes
<div className={`${rule} ${another}`}>
  zomg
</div>

// merge rules for great justice
let mono = css({
  fontFamily: 'monospace'
})

let bolder = css({
  fontWeight: 'bolder'
})

<div {...css(mono, bolder)}>
  bold code!
</div>

```

motivation
---

This expands on ideas from @vjeux's [2014 css-in-js talk](https://speakerdeck.com/vjeux/react-css-in-js).
We introduce an api to annotate arbitrary dom nodes with style definitions ('rules') for, um, the greater good.

features
---

- fast / efficient, with a fluent api
- framework independent
- adds vendor prefixes / fallback values
- supports all the pseudo :classes/::elements
- `@media` queries
- `@supports` statements
- `@font-face` / `@keyframes`
- escape hatches for parent / child / contextual selectors
- dev helper to simulate pseudo classes like `:hover`, etc
- server side / static rendering
- tests / coverage
- experimental - [write real css](https://github.com/threepointone/glamor/blob/master/docs/css.md), with syntax highlighting and linting


(thanks to [BrowserStack](https://www.browserstack.com/) for providing the infrastructure that allows us to run our build in real browsers.)

speedy mode
---

there are two methods by which the library adds styles to the document -
- by appending css 'rules' to a browser backed stylesheet. This is really fast, but has the disadvantage of making the styles uneditable in the devtools sidebar.
- by appending text nodes to a style tag. This is fairly slow, but doesn't have the editing drawback.

as a compromise, we enable the former 'speedy' mode `NODE_ENV=production`, and disable it otherwise. You can manually toggle this with the `speedy()` function.

characteristics
---

while glamor shares most common attributes of other inline style / css-in-js systems,
here are some key differences -

- uses 'real' stylesheets, so you can use all css features.
- rules can be used as data-attributes or classNames.
- simulate pseudo-classes with the `simulate` helper. very useful, especially when combined when hot-loading and/or editing directly in devtools.
- really fast, by way of deduping rules, and using [insertRule](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/CSSStyleSheet/insertRule) in production.


todo
