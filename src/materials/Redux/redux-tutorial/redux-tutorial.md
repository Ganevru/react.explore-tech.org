This repository contains a step by step tutorial to help grasp flux and more specifically [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).

The official and very exhaustive Redux documentation is available [here](http://redux.js.org/) and should be your number one source of truth regarding Redux. The present tutorial will only offer you an introduction to flux concepts through Redux use. For further or more detailed info, please refer to the Redux documentation.

### Prerequisites
It is required for you to know a bit of ES6 and ES7 (Object Spread) to correctly understand some of the examples given in this repo. Also be aware that this tutorial targets redux 3.0.2 and react-redux 4.0.0.

### Clone the repository
`git clone https://github.com/happypoulp/redux-tutorial.git`

### Move into repository
`cd redux-tutorial`

### Install dependencies

### Browse the tutorial

This tutorial is split into a sequence of javascript files that are intended to be read in order.
