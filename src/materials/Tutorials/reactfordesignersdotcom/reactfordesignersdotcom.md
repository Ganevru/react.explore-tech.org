# Framer React Component inspector

If you're interested in contributing, some things that need to be created:

1. Markdown support
Would be great to write each component breakdown article as a single markdown file with both the code snippets and the explainer text in one. Even better would be to use this format: http://cl.ly/LxEu

2. Click on code, highlight relevant section
You can currently click on sections of text and it highlights the code. Would be cool if the inverse was possible.

3. Home page
The home page http://localhost:3000/framer is not working right now. Ideally it would be a grid of components and clicking on each would route to http://localhost:3001/framer/component-name. 

4. Back to home button
From the http://localhost:3001/framer/sample page, there should be a back button to return to the home grid view.

5. ðŸ’™Whatever else you can think up!
So excited to have people want to contribute and make this happen. Any ideas you have just go for it.
