## Motivation
I spent a lot of time searching for new libs, frameworks, and ideas. There are currently loads of GitHub repos online that share wonderful projects, but I wanted to build something visual to help people learn and grow.

This website was built based on three main points:

1. Help people learn, develop and explore tech
1. Free and non-profit, all developed and designed to help people.
1. Building a community to share projects together.


# Overall Goal with explore-tech.org
Using this template to design other websites, for example, have a GraphQL, Node, react-native websites to help people explore and learn that tech too. This is all non-profit work, just inspired to help others develop.
